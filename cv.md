# About Me
I am 31 years old. The code is our everything, I also have a craving for new things and knowledge. In my free time, I like to read or walk. From the experience I already have, I can say that there is no such thing as a lot of knowledge. A team player, responsible, it happens that I use more time to fully understand what and how it works.
